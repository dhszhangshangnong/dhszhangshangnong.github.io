  <h2> You got to get to know me. </h2>
  <p> My name is Kal-El and I was born on the planet <a href="page1.html">Krypton</a>,
    before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by my scientist father Jor-El, moments before Krypton's destruction.</p>
  <p> I was discovered and adopted by a Kansas farm couple, raised as Clark Kent, and imbued with a strong moral compass.</p>
  <p> Very early on I started to display various superhuman abilities, which, upon reaching maturity, I resolved to use for the benefit of humanity through a secret "Superman" identity.</p>
  
  <h2> Where  you'll find me. </h2>
  <p> I reside and operate in the American city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)"> Metropolis </a>
  as a journalist for the Daily Planet.</p>
